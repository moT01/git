# Introduction

> Welcome to the introduction to git lessons. Git is a popular version control system that helps manage your code. Have fun!

## 10. Restart Terminal

### 10.1

**THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS RESTART THE TERMINAL.** Type `exit` into the terminal below and press enter. After that, open a new one by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo git` into the terminal and press enter.

#### HINTS

- Follow the directions closely
- If the tests don't pass, redo those instructions

## 20. Make Directory

### 20.1

I will be expecting you to do everything from the terminal for these lessons :smile: Use the terminal below to make a new directory named `git-practice` in the `project` folder. As a reminder, you can use the `mkdir` command to make a new folder.

#### HINTS

- Enter `mkdir git-practice` in the terminal
- Don't try to create the folder with another method
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the `project` folder if you aren't there

## 30. Change Directory

### 30.1

Use the "change directory" command in the terminal to change to your new folder.

#### HINTS

- Enter `cd git-practice` into the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the `project` folder if you aren't there

## 40. Initialize a git Repository

### 40.1

This folder will be your git repository. To turn it into one, type `git init` into the terminal from this folder.

#### HINTS

- Enter `git init` into the terminal while in the `git-practice` folder
- Make sure you are in the `git-practice` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project/git-practice` to get to the `git-practice` folder if you aren't there
